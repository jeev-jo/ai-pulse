## What is AI Pulse?

AI moves fast. Most coverage is either too technical, too shallow, or buried in hype.

**AI Pulse** is a weekly article published every **Tuesday** that takes the most important AI developments from the past seven days and explains them in plain language — with context, citations, and an honest take on what it means for real people.

No panic. No hype. Just the signal.
